# Warhol Filter

We write an algorithm that takes in a square patch like the photo of Simba the Dog, attached in this repository: 

And creates an image which has the patch copied 50 times (in 5 rows and 10 columns) where each patch gets re-colored. This effect is inspired by some of Andy Warholâ€™s paintings. 


We implement a function, like this:

def make_recolored_patch(red_scale, green_scale, blue_scale): 


We experiment with different combinations of red_scale, green_scale and blue_scale, and then get our desired filters. For example, the pink Simba was generated by 

make_recolored_patch(1.5, 0, 1.5)
